# Detect-masks-real-time-video-streams
In this Python programming , we will learn building a Face Mask Detector using Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV.  We will also see how to apply this on a Live Video Camera. With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV cameras to detect and identify people without masks.
